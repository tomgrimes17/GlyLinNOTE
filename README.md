Welcome to GlycLinNOTE!

GlycLinNOTE is a piece of software, written in Python, that enables users to convert between different N-glycan notations, including: Linear notation, IUPAC condensed notation, and Symbol notation (SNFG). GlycLinNOTE runs on Google colab, meaning users do not have to download the software to use it. To access the documentation associated with GlycLinNOTE, please use the following hyperlinks:

As GlycLinNOTE is an interactive piece of software, users can access all program options through following the instructions in the terminal at the bottom of this page. To do this, simply click Runtime in the task bar followed by Run all. This may take a few minutes before the terminal appears. After completing all tasks in GlycLinNOTE, a zipped folder containing all SNFGs (N-glycan sructures) created during the session will be automatically downloaded.

Thankyou in advance for using GlycLinNOTE!
